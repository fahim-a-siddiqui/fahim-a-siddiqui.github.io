I refuse to use social media. That also includes Linkedin. Like, God, what do we even have emails for anymore? 

Email: [{{ site.email }}](mailto: {{ site.email }})

GitHub: [{{ site.github_username }}](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})

Huggingface: [{{ site.github_username }}](https://huggingface.co/{{ site.github_username }})

StoryGraph: [ommorsaphine](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ommorsaphine)


I guess that's all. And no, I'm not giving you my phone number here.
