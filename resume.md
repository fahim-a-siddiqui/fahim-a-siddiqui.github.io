**Fahim Ahmad Siddiqui: reader, writer, and coder.** 

I am a passionate researcher who likes messing around with AI models, working on my short story collections under my pen name, and coding on the side. I fell in love with AI during the summer vacation of eleventh grade, and haven't stopped tinkering with them yet. I am a native English speaker and am also versed in the Bangla language. Based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

## Hobbies/Interests
My hobbies include being an AI hobbyist (maintaing this research blog, coding a bit, trying to break AI models), writing (on my diary blog, and my fiction), reading (posts on my RSS reader, sometimes philosophy books, listening to stories from time to time),  doodling (helps me think and also relieves screen fatigue), walking (helps me think as well), and listening to podcasts. 

My interests are: digital minimalism (got my phone screentime under twenty minutes a day), gardening (I have a pet plant), academic studying (oh God, I hate it), and trying to live a more boring life.


## Education
Currently enrolled as a high school student at the International Hope School Bangladesh. *More to come soon, God-willing. I really hope I can do a Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy.* 

## Skills
A few things, I suppose. Maybe like: 
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, Jekyll: all of which I used to build this blog)
- Writing (essays on this blog and my fiction)
- Rising at five-forty in the morning and sleeping by ten roughly every day

## Projects
Okay, I haven't done much, alright? 

## Contacts

I should certainly make a real professional resume. I'll have to link it here.
