**Fahim Ahmad Siddiqui: student, writer, and coder.** 

I am a passionate researcher who likes watching lectures in philosophy, working on my short story collections under my pen name, and coding on the side. I fell in love with AI during the summer vacation of eleventh grade, and haven't stopped tinkering with them yet. I am a native English speaker and am also versed in the Bangla language. Based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

## Interests
Digital minimalism (I got my phone screen time under twenty minutes a day), artificial intelligence, philosophy, maybe some parts of mathematics, blogging, fiction writing, reading an unhealthy amount of sci-fi and non-fiction, and spending time with my cat.

## Education
Currently enrolled as a high school student at the International Hope School Bangladesh. *More to come soon, God-willing. I really hope I can do a Bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy.* 

## Skills
A few things, I suppose. Maybe like: 
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, Jekyll: all of which I used to build this blog)
- Writing (essays on this blog)
- A little bit of an understanding in AI and Philosophy
