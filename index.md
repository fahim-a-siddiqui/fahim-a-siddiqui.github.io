This is my research blog where I post essays on technology, philosophical opinions and everything in between. I'm Fahim, an independent writer and AI hobbyist who has always thought AI is more than just the algorithms. When I'm not writing essays, I'm either reading a book, writing a story, or doodling some terrible art. 

You may find me at [my email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). If you see me on social media, it's likely an imposter or someone who happens to share my name. If you want to reference my work, a simple citation enough.
