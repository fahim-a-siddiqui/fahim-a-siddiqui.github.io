I like playing with AI models and reading/writing stories. I've tried a whole set of hobbies, but these are the only ones that have stuck throughout the years. I also walk when I'm deep in thought and I don't know, do other stuff. 

I write fiction under my pen name O.M. Morsaphine. It's a hassle to maintain two different online identies, so here you go: Fahim Ahmad Siddiqui = O.M. Morsaphine. Satisifed now? 

If you see me on social media, it's likely an imposter or someone who happens to share my name. If you want to reference my work, a simple citation enough.
