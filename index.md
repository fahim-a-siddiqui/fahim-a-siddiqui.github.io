I like playing with AI models and reading/writing stories. I've tried a whole set of hobbies, but these are the only ones that have stuck throughout the years. I also walk when I'm deep in thought and doodle when I need a break from the screen. 

My pen name is Ohium Merck Morsaphine, but I prefer O.M. Morsaphine as it's short. I maintain a [diary](https://ommorsaphine.bearblog.dev/) under it and also a [reading profile](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/ommorsaphine). 

You may find me at [my email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). If you see me on social media, it's likely an imposter or someone who happens to share my name. If you want to reference my work, a simple citation enough.
