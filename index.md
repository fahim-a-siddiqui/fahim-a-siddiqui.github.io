This is my blog where I post essays on philosophy, technology and everything in between. I'm Fahim, an independent writer who has always thought AI is more than just the algorithms. When I'm not writing essays, I'm either reading a book, writing a story, or spending too much time on YouTube. 

You may find me at [my email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}). If you see me on social media, it's likely an imposter or someone who happens to share my name. If you want to reference my work, a simple citation is enough[^1].
