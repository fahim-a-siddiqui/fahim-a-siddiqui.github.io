If you are reading this, this must mean my blog is alive! Yes, after two months of coding, reviewing, and losing about half of my code in the middle, I was finally able to make a professional blog. 

As you must have read from the homepage, my research blog (this is what I prefer to call it) is my home of essays. This is where my non-fiction writing can rest. I am primarily interested in philosophy, but since I spend so much time behind a screen everyday, I might write something on computer science from time to time. 

If you are interested in reading my fiction—I only really write short stories—you will be glad to know that I write under the pen name 'Ohium Merck Morsaphine', or for short 'O.M. Morsaphine'. The latter is more memorable and preferred. I maintain a personal blog which acts as my diary in [my other blog](https://ommorsaphine.bearblog.dev/) under my pen name as well.

I am not much of a coder; I prefer to write instead, so my research blog is likely to not be very technical. I am hoping I can maintain a monthly frequency of posting, but since I am a human and not an AI, I may sometimes not achieve my target. Posts should be published at the first of every month, that is if my schedule allows it. Donations are always immensely appreciated and help keep the site running. 

If you have any questions or want to comment on any of my essays, please feel free to reach me via email. I should respond to you within a day.
