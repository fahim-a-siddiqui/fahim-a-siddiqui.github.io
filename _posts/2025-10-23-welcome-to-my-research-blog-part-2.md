For some unexplainable reason, my blog page only shows posts when there are at least two published posts. That is why I am writing this one. As you must know by now, I am not a very technical person, so I have written this companion post to cover this faulty feature. If you are interested in this imperfect source code, you may find it [here ](https://github.com/fahim-a-siddiqui/fahim-a-siddiqui.github.io). 

I must thank knhash in creating the Jekyll theme I modified for my research blog. You may find his work in this [repository](https://github.com/knhash/jekyllBear) I also have to thank the person who made the code I use to calculate the reading time for my posts. I found it accidently on the internet in [this link](https://excessivelyadequate.com/posts/ert.html). 

I also have to thank you, dear reader, for browsing through my humble little site in the digital mess that is the internet. Only time will tell if my research blog will continue living on, within my lifetime or outside it. With that said, I hope you use your time well. We are all given so short of it. 

Also, here is a [markdown cheatsheet](https://herman.bearblog.dev/markdown-cheatsheet/) I'm attaching for myself for future references since I am so bad at remembering things.
