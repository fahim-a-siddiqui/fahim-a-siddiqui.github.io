What does it mean for a machine to “understand”?  
This essay explores how intelligence might not only *solve* problems but also *reflect* upon them.

## 1. Mirrors of Thought

The concept of reflection has always fascinated me.  
Human intelligence is recursive — it thinks about thinking — whereas machine intelligence is, so far, **performative**, not reflective.

## 2. A Simple Analogy

Let’s start with something simple:  

```python
# A machine that asks itself what it is
def self_reflect():
    question = "What am I?"
    print(f"{question} -> I am a program that prints '{question}'")

self_reflect()
```
